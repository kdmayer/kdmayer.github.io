## Kevin Mayer

I am a PhD student with Martin Fischer at Stanford University

My research focuses on the decarbonization of the built environment and integrates work in computer vision, remote sensing, and geographical information systems.

Before coming to Stanford University, I earned a bachelor's and master's degree in industrial engineering from TU Berlin.
